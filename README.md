# My Garden
A gardening app for everyone!

As an amature gardner it is sometimes difficult to know what plants need more attention than others. This is what My Garden seeks to change.

The My Garden App allows users to search for plants and get information about how to care for them properly. To avoid continaully searching
for plant data, we have added a favorites section or "My Garden" that allows users quick and easy access to information about
plants they favorite. 

With an easy to use UI, data from third party API's and links to instructional videos, My Garden is the information portal for both new and experienced gardeners.
